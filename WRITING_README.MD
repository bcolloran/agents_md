# General README writing guidelines
- Keep it concise and to the point.
- Use clear headings and subheadings to organize content.

## Front matter
Include Github CI and Codecov badge under the title.

# Examples

Include code examples that demonstrate how to use the project effectively. Use fenced code blocks with appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting.

Near the top of the  README, Include one or two simple examples that show the most common use cases of the project. These examples should be easy to understand and should highlight the key features of the project.

Near the bottom of the README, include a "More examples" section with more comprehensive examples that demonstrate advanced usage and features of the project. These examples can be longer and more detailed, and should showcase the full capabilities of the project.

For rust projects, include examples in the `README.md` that can be run as doctests. This helps ensure that the examples stay up to date and correct. Make sure to set up the crate to include the README.md as crate-level documentation, so that the doctests in the README.md are run as part of `cargo test`.
